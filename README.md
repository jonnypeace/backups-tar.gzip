# Incremental Backups using .tgz

These should work independant of where the scripts are stored.

I've added verbose to the backups, but if being run in a cron job, it's not really necessary.

Edit the scripts and update the directories as necessary (first few line variables)

Edit the file variable name to suit your needs, but leave the .sngz in place. incfile=file.inc

For cron, these are hard coded, no options in the command line, just full automation.
